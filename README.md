# PWA-text-editor

Wee 19 Challenge

## Description

This project was created to familiarize myself with the process of converting an application into a PWA that can be deployed in a live environment and installed by the user. The "meat" of this app was given to me as starter code. My job was to add in functionality for a service worker and, through the use of webpack, add the ability for the app to be bundled into a downloadable PWA. This project has helped me greatly to understand the steps necessary to incorporate the webpack package and find the necessary information it requires to enable PWA installation.
